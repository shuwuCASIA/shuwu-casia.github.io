Coursework
==========

Grading
-------

-  **Assignments (40%)**: There will be four assignments, each counting
   10%.
-  **Midterm (30%)**: There will be an online midterm in week 7.
-  **Group project (30%)**: You are required to complete a group project
   applying techniques learned in this course on an NLP problem.

Assignments
-----------

The assignments will contain both written problems and programming
problems.

-  **Late policy**: All assignments are due at 11:59pm (New York time)
   on the due date. You have 5 late days in total that can be
   distributed among the assignments. However, homeworks will not be
   accepted after 48 hours.
-  **Collaboration policy**: You may discuss problems with your
   classmates. However, you must write up the homework solutions and the
   code from scratch, without referring to notes from your joint
   session. In your solution to each problem, you must write down the
   names of any person with whom you discussed the problem—this will not
   affect your grade.
-  **Submission**: Assignments are submitted through
   `Gradescope <https://www.gradescope.com/courses/148490>`__. At the
   beginning of the semester, you will be added to the Gradescope class
   roster. This will give you access to the course page, and the
   assignment submission form. If you have not used Gradescope before,
   please watch this `short
   video <https://www.gradescope.com/get_started>`__.

Projects
--------

The project allows you to apply what you have learned from the course to
a real problem. You are asked to complete the project in a group of size
1 to 5 members.

-  **Topics**: You can choose any topics in NLP. Take a look at the `ACL
   proceedings <https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/>`__ for inspiration.
   Here are some general directions:

   -  A new algorithm or model for existing problems, e.g., detecting
      out-of-domain examples in QA)
   -  A new application of language technology, e.g., solving problems
      in social sciences
   -  Analysis of a dataset, a model, or a approach, e.g., what are the
      caveats, pros/cons, and interpretations

-  **Deliverables**:

   -  **Proposal (0%)**: You are required to submit a two-page proposal
      on Nov 3 (week 9). The proposal is not graded but we will provide
      feedback through office hours.
   -  **Presentation (10%)**: Each group should upload a recored
      presentation of no more than 15 minutes before Dec 8. During the
      last lecture, each group will give a spotlight presentation of
      their work followed by Q&A.
   -  **Report (20%)**: The final report is due on Dec 20. Each group
      should submit a report in .pdf in the ACL templates
      (`LaTex/Word <http://acl2020.org/downloads/acl2020-templates.zip>`__,
      `Overleaf <https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acl-2020-proceedings-template/zsrkcwjptpcd>`__).
