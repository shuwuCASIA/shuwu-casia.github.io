Text classification
===================

We will start our journey with a simple NLP problem, text
classification. You might have already gone through the core techniques
if you have taken an ML course, however, we hope to provide some new
insights from the NLP perspective.

Let’s consider the binary sentiment classification task. Our input is a
document (e.g. a review), and we want to predict whether it is positive
or negative.

We will use the IMDB movie review dataset as our running example.

.. code:: python

    from d2l import mxnet as d2l
    from mxnet import gluon, np, npx
    import gluonnlp as nlp
    npx.set_np()
    train_dataset = nlp.data.IMDB(root='data/imdb', segment='train')

An intuitive approach
---------------------

Let’s pretend for a second that we don’t know anything about ML or NLP.
How should we approach this problem? Let’s take a look at the data to
have a better sense of the problem.

.. code:: python

    print('# training examples:', len(train_dataset))
    print(train_dataset[0])
    print('labels:', set([d[1] for d in train_dataset]))


.. parsed-literal::
    :class: output

    # training examples: 25000
    ['Bromwell High is a cartoon comedy. It ran at the same time as some other programs about school life, such as "Teachers". My 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that Bromwell High\'s satire is much closer to reality than is "Teachers". The scramble to survive financially, the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers\' pomp, the pettiness of the whole situation, all remind me of the schools I knew and their students. When I saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school, I immediately recalled ......... at .......... High. A classic line: INSPECTOR: I\'m here to sack one of your teachers. STUDENT: Welcome to Bromwell High. I expect that many adults of my age think that Bromwell High is far fetched. What a pity that it isn\'t!', 9]
    labels: {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10}


While the review itself can be quite complex, we don’t really need to
understand everything in it. To separate positive and negative reviews,
we might be able to just look at individual words. Intuitively, we
expect to see more nice words in positive reviews such as “fantastic”
and “wonderful”. Let’s test our intuition against the data.

Before we start to play with the data, we need to **tokenize** the text,
i.e. separating the string into a list of **tokens**. The definition of
a token can be language- and task-dependent. One common choise is to
split the string into words. For example, we can use a simple regex to
tokenize English text, however, it doesn’t work for Chinese which
doesn’t have word boundary markers such as spaces. Similarly, in German
there is no spaces in compound nouns, which can get long. A more general
solution is to discard the notion of words and tokenize by subwords
strings, e.g. characters (n-grams) or byte pair encoding. For more
information on tokenization, read [JM 2.4.2]. In most cases we can use
existing tokenizers in text processing libraries such as NLTK or SpaCy.

Let’s tokenize the data and map the ratings to binary labels. Also, for
efficiency we randomly sample a subset.

.. code:: python

    tokenizer = nlp.data.SpacyTokenizer('en')
    preprocess = lambda d : (tokenizer(d[0].lower()), 1 if int(d[1]) > 5 else 0)
    
    import random
    mini_dataset = [preprocess(d) for d in random.choices(train_dataset, k=1000)]
    print(mini_dataset[0][1], mini_dataset[0][0][:20])


.. parsed-literal::
    :class: output

    0 ['in', '1993', ',', '"', 'the', 'visitors', '"', 'was', 'an', 'enormous', 'hit', 'in', 'france', '.', 'so', ',', 'the', 'sequence', 'was', 'inevitable']


.. code:: python

    import itertools
    pos_tokens = list(itertools.chain.from_iterable([d[0] for d in mini_dataset if d[1] == 1]))
    neg_tokens = list(itertools.chain.from_iterable([d[0] for d in mini_dataset if d[1] == 0]))
    print(len(pos_tokens), len(neg_tokens))


.. parsed-literal::
    :class: output

    134122 141254


Now we can check the counts of a word in positive and negative examples.

.. code:: python

    token = 'wonderful'
    print(pos_tokens.count(token))
    print(neg_tokens.count(token))


.. parsed-literal::
    :class: output

    49
    13


So a simple heuristic approach is to count the frequency of occurence of
each word in positive and negative examples, and classifiy an example as
positive if it contains more words of high-frequency in the positive
examples. **The key takeaway** is that we can do a reasonable job
classifying the text based on individual words without understanding its
meaning.

.. _sec_nb:

Naive Bayes model
-----------------


Now, let’s take a more principled approach, following the key steps we
talked about last time: design a model, specify a loss function, and
minimize the average loss.

Consider a probabilistic model for binary classification:

.. math::


   f_w(x) = \begin{cases} 
   1 & \text{if $p_w(y\mid x) > 0.5$} \\
   0 & \text{otherwise}
   \end{cases} .

How do we parameterize :math:`p_w(y\mid x)`? Recall the Bayes rule from
probability:

.. math::


   p(y\mid x) = \frac{p(x\mid y) p(y)}{p(x)}
   = \frac{p(x\mid y) p(y)}{\sum_{y\in\mathcal{Y}}p(x\mid y) p(y)} .

Given that :math:`y` is binary, it’s reasonable to model it as a
Bernoulli random variable. For more than two classes, we can use a
categorical distribution.

What about :math:`p(x\mid y)`? Note that it’s the joint probability of
all words in the sentence :math:`x`:
:math:`p(x\mid y) = p(x_1, \ldots, x_n \mid y)` (:math:`n` is the
document length), where :math:`x_i` is the token at the :math:`i`-th
position in the document. Directly modeling the joint probability will
require a huge number of parameters (and can only be learned if we have
a huge corpus). Following our intuition, we can ignore the interaction
among all words and assume that they are **conditionally independt**.
This is the key assumption in Naive Bayes models:

.. math::


   p(x_1, \ldots, x_n \mid y) = \prod_{i=1}^n p(x_i\mid y) .

Let’s think about the data generating process. To generate a review, we
first flip a coin to decide its sentiment, then roll a :math:`|V|`-sided
die for :math:`n` steps to decide the word at each position (:math:`|V|`
denotes the vocabulary size). Therefore,
:math:`p(x_1, \ldots, x_n \mid y)` is given by a multinomial
distribution.

Maximum likelihood estimation
-----------------------------

Now that we have specified the model, the next step is to estimate
parameters. For probabilistic models, we can use maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE), corresponding to the negative log-likelihood (NLL)
loss.

Our goal is to maximize the log-likelihood of the dataset
:math:`D = \{x^{(i)}, y^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^N`:

.. math::


   \log \prod_{i=1}^N p(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})
   = \log \prod_{i=1}^N \prod_{j=1}^{L_i} p(x_j^{(i)}\mid y^{(i)}) p(y^{(i)}),

where :math:`L_i` is the length of the :math:`i`-th example. We can plug
in the probability mass function (pmf) of Bernoulli and multinomial
distribution and carry out the optimization.

In this case, we have a closed-form solution (and a very intuitive one).
The conditionaly probability of each word given a label is simply the
percentage of time it occurs in documents with that label:

.. math::


   p(x_j \mid y) = \frac{\text{count}(x_j, y)}{\sum_{x\in V} \text{count}(x, y)},

where :math:`V` is the vocabulary and :math:`\text{count}(x_j, y)` is
the count of word :math:`x_j` in documents with label :math:`y`. So we
have re-discovered our intuitive method through the Naive Bayes model!

Laplace smoothing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One potential problem of our estimator is that a word that doesn’t occur
in the training set will have zero probability. For example, if none of
the positive reviews contain the word “awwwwwwwesome”, any review
containing that word will have zero probability given the positive
label. This is undesirable because due to the sparsity of language it’s
not uncommon to have unknown words at test time. Even if we ignore
unknown words in the input, we will have problems with rare words (low
frequency in the training set), because their estimated conditional
probabilities might be off.

To remedy this problem, we use a technique called “smoothing”, which add
pseudocounts to the actual count of each word:

.. math::


   p(x_j \mid y) = \frac{\alpha + \text{count}(x_j, y)}{\alpha |V| + \sum_{x\in V}\text{count}(x, y)} .

This means that even before we have seen any data, we believe that all
words should occur :math:`\alpha` times. For Laplace smoothing
:math:`\alpha=1`.

**Question:** what happens when we increase/decrease :math:`\alpha`?

Logistic regression
-------------------

You might have wondered in Naive Bayes modeling why did we take the
trouble to rewrite :math:`p(y\mid x)` using the Bayes’ rule instead of
directy modeling the conditional distribution. After all, that’s the
distribution we use for prediction. Also, we don’t have to make
assumptions on how :math:`x` is generated (e.g. conditional
independence). In fact, models like Naive Bayes that models
:math:`p(x\mid y)` are called **generative models** and they usually
assume a generative story of how the data is generated. Models that
directly model :math:`p(y\mid x)` are called **discriminative models**.
Both approaches have merits. However, if you have lots of data,
empirically discriminative models may be better since it makes less
assumptions about the data distribution.

How should we model :math:`p(y\mid x)`? Similar to the Naive Bayes
model, since :math:`y` is binary, we can model it by a Bernoulli
distribution: :math:`p(y\mid x) = h(x)^y(1-h(x))^{1-y}`. Here
:math:`h(x)` is :math:`p(y=1\mid x)`. Ideally, we would like :math:`x`
to enter the equation through a score :math:`w\cdot \phi(x)` (think
linear regression), where :math:`w` is the **weight vector** we want to
learn and :math:`\phi\colon \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d` is a
**feature extractor** that maps a piece of text to a vector. Note that
here we can ignore the bias term in :math:`w\cdot\phi(x) + b`, assuming
that a dimension of constant value 1 is incorporated in :math:`\phi`.

To map the score to a probability, we use the **logistic function**:

.. code:: python

    %matplotlib inline
    from IPython import display
    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    
    display.set_matplotlib_formats('svg')
    x = np.arange(-10, 10, 0.01)
    plt.plot(x, 1/(1+np.exp(-x)))
    plt.ylabel('$1/(1+e^{-w\cdot\phi(x)})$')
    plt.xlabel('$w\cdot\phi(x)$')




.. parsed-literal::
    :class: output

    Text(0.5, 0, '$w\\cdot\\phi(x)$')




.. figure:: output_text_classification_e2cfc8_10_1.svg


Note that larger score corresponds to higher :math:`p(y=1\mid x)`. This
gives us the logistic regression model:

.. math::


   p(y=1\mid x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-w\cdot\phi(x)}} .

For multiclass classification, :math:`p(y\mid x)` is modeled by a
multinomial distribution and we transform the scores
:math:`w_k\cdot \phi(x)` (k:raw-latex:`\in `:raw-latex:`\mathcal{Y}`)
using the **softmax function**:

.. math::


   p(y=k\mid x) = \frac{e^{w_k\cdot\phi(x)}}{\sum_{i\in\mathcal{Y}} e^{w_i\cdot\phi(x)}} .

Similar to Naive Bayes, we can use MLE to estimate :math:`w`. But for
logistic regression we don’t have a closed-form solution (try it) and
need to use (stochastic) gradient descent. The objective function is
concave, so we can always reach a global optimal solution.

**Exercise:** Show that MLE for logistic regression is equivalent to
minimizing the average logistic loss.

Bag-of-words (BoW) representation
---------------------------------

We have ignored one question above in logistic regression: what is the
feature extractor :math:`\phi`? We need to represent the document as a
vector that can work with our linear model.

How are we going to represent a piece of text? If we want the
representation the whole sequence it’s going to be challenging (an
exponentially large set). Following our intuition, it may be sufficient
to just consider individual words for our task. The BoW representation
is a vector :math:`x = (1, x_1, \ldots, x_d)` where
:math:`x_i \in \mathbb{N}`. Each coordinate corresponds to a unique word
in the vocabulary, thus :math:`d` is the vocabulary size here. Note that
the first dimensition corresponds to the bias term. The value
:math:`x_i` is the count of the :math:`i`-th word in the input text.
It’s called a bag of words because we are throwing away the position
information.

**Example.** To map a sequence of tokens to the BoW vector, first we
need to build the vocabulary.

.. code:: python

    vocab = nlp.Vocab(nlp.data.count_tokens(pos_tokens + neg_tokens))
    print(len(vocab))


.. parsed-literal::
    :class: output

    19960


Convert an example to BoW vector representation:

.. code:: python

    # map words to ints
    x = np.array(vocab(mini_dataset[0][0]))
    # convert to vector of counts
    x = npx.one_hot(x, len(vocab)).sum(axis=0)
    print('feature vector size:', x.shape)
    # show counts
    print('top word counts:')
    ids = [int(i) for i in np.argsort(x)[::-1][:10]]
    print([(vocab.idx_to_token[i], int(x[i])) for i in ids])


.. parsed-literal::
    :class: output

    feature vector size: (19960,)
    top word counts:
    [('the', 25), (',', 13), ('.', 13), ('and', 11), ('in', 10), ('a', 9), ('of', 8), ('movie', 8), ('-', 7), ('is', 5)]


**Side note.** Note that here the feature vector is different from the
one we used for the Naive Bayes model. In :numref:`sec_nb`, our
effective feature vector (we didn’t need to explicit represent it then)
is a sequence of words in the input, thus its length varies across
examples, whereas here the feature vector has a fixed dimension of the
vocabulary size. One can show that the Naive Bayes model we described
above corresponds to assuming a multinomial distribution of the count
vector :math:`\phi(x)`, thus it’s also called a Multinomial Naive Bayes
model.

.. _sec_feature_extractor:

Feature extractor
-----------------


Looking at the word counts in our BoW feature vector above, clearly, we
don’t have very informative features. In addition, only considering
single words (**unigram**) breaks compound nouns (e.g. “ice cream”) and
proper nouns (e.g. “New York”). It’s also hard to represent negation
(e.g. “not good at all”), which is important especially in sentiment
classification. One easy fix is to consider an **n-gram** (:math:`n`
consecutive words in a document) as a single word. For text
classification, bi-gram is commonly used.

But what if we want to use even richer features, such as whether the
suffix of a word contains repeated letters (e.g. “yayyyyy”). One
advantage of using logistic regression instead of Naive Bayes is that it
allows for rich features using the feature extractor :math:`\phi`.

For example, we can define the following functions given an input
:math:`x` of :math:`n` tokens with label :math:`y`:

.. math::


   \phi_1(x) &= \begin{cases}
   1 & \text{$\exists x_i\in \{x_1,\ldots x_n\}$ such that $x_i=$"happy"} \\
   0 & \text{otherwise}
   \end{cases} ,
   \\
   \phi_2(x) &= \begin{cases}
   1 & \text{$\exists x_i\in \{x_1,\ldots x_n\}$ such that $\text{suffix}(x_i, 4)=$"yyyy"} \\
   0 & \text{otherwise}
   \end{cases} ,

so on and so forth.

**Side note.** In practice, we may have a huge number of features
(e.g. all n-grams in a corpus). However, for NLP problems the features
are often sparse, meaning that we only have a handful of non-zero
features. Thus it’s common to represent the feature value as a string
and hash it to integers (feature index),
e.g. :math:`\text{hash}(\text{"w=happy"}) = 1`. See
`FeatureHasher <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.FeatureHasher.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.FeatureHasher>`__
